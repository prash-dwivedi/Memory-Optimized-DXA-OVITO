# Memory-Optimized DXA in OVITO

This repository offers a solution for performing Dislocation Analysis (DXA) on large datasets in OVITO while addressing memory limitations. By preprocessing datasets to reduce the number of atoms analyzed, this method ensures computational efficiency. Although defect meshes generated by this approach may not be fully accurate, dislocation lines are expected to remain connected with an acceptable error margin (10-15%), depending on the parameters chosen for defect region expansion.

## ðŸ“‹ Background

Dislocation Analysis (DXA) is a critical step in materials science for understanding deformation mechanisms in crystalline materials. However, when working with large-scale atomistic simulations, memory limitations can make DXA infeasible. OVITO's native DXA implementation requires the entire dataset to fit into memory, which can become challenging for simulations containing millions of atoms.

To overcome this limitation, this repository introduces a method to:
1. Identify and preprocess defective regions using `Polyhedral Template Matching (PTM)` or `Common Neighbor Analysis (CNA)`.
2. Expand the selection of defective atoms to include nearby regions.
3. Perform DXA only on the selected subset of atoms, significantly reducing memory usage.
